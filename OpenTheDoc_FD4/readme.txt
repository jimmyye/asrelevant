Installation
* Get FlashDevelop
* Get OpenTheDoc, v 3.0.0+ for FD4 only
  - If FD4, run OpenTheDoc.fdz
  - If FD3, unzip OpenTheDoc.zip and in FD click Tools > Application Files, then put OpenTheDoc.dll into the Plugins folder
* Restart FD

Settings
* Set DocPaths  (Tools > Program Settings > OpenTheDoc) to contain your documentation folders
  - 4 kinds of DocPath accepted:
    X:\path\to\alldocs\as3\
    X:\path\to\alldocs\*, means all folders in alldocs
    $(ProjectPath)\docs, documentation of current project
    $(GlobalClasspaths)\..\docs, documentations of global classes
* Click "Refresh Contents" on (OpenTheDoc) Help Panel to update

Usage
* Move cursor on an word (a class, method, property, etc.) and press F1, the documentation will be open in Help Panel if exsits
* Ctrl+F1, same to F1 but open in a new tab
* Shift+F1 to simply open Help Panel
* Use all three shortcuts to close Help Panel

Help Panel
* Shows contents tree of a documentation (A TOC(Table Of Contents) file is needed) (See TocGen below)
* Title search: search titles of TOC files
* Tabbed browsing
* SingleInstanceMode: Only one HelpPanel for multiple FlashDevelop instances

Documentations
* Support unorganized documentations with TOC, e.g. AS2 reference in Flash IDE.
* Support Well-organized documentations without TOC. (Use TocGen to generate a TOC).
* Well-organized documentations with TOC, check out http://livedocs.adobe.com.
* Documentation categories. Categorize by attribute "categories" of the root node of TOC file.
* Categories are also used to filter context search (API search) results. i.e. docs categorized in as2 are only available in as2 projects. Uncategorized docs have no constraints.

Some ASDocs release with Flash IDE and Flex Builder.
Flex3 reference in Flex Builder 3: 
Find doc.zip and extract it to SomeFolder\doc\, put toc.xml and tocAPI.xml to the same folder.
toc.xml is for Flex Help, and tocAPI.xml is for Language Reference.

Flex 4 Reference
Download: http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_flex4_alldocumentation_en
It contains some pdfs (we don't need) and a zip file named AS3_Reference.zip,
unzip it to a folder and generate a TOC for it.
If you find there is something wrong with scrolling on these pages,
here is a work around:
Open style.css in that folder, go to line 1382, and change
[code]div.mainright  {
	height:100%;
	overflow-y:auto;
	bottom:0px;
	left:6px;
	top:0px;
	right:0px;
	position:absolute;
}[/code]
to
[code]div.mainright  {
	height:100%;
	/* overflow-y:auto; */
	bottom:0px;
	left:6px;
	top:0px;
	right:0px;
	position:absolute;
}[/code]

2.0.0  2008-10-07
0. Change a lot
1. Add a panel and Help Contents
2. Show related topics in the panel
3. TOC has higher priority than Well-organized when parsing a document


1.0.2  2007-12-14
Works with AS2 docs now, thanks to the help_toc.xml file. 

1.0.1  2007-12-12 
DocPahts: You can now set paths as many as you want, instead of 4. 
Aative DocPaths: Indices of DocPaths you want OpenTheDoc to search (orderly). The first available doc will be opened. Assume that URLs are always available. 
Shortcut: Custom shortcut works now! 
Handle F1: If you like to OpenTheDoc when press F1, set this true. If OpenTheDoc doesnot find any available docs, FD handles this. 
Change "someClass.html#function" to "someClass.html#function()". 

1.0.0  2007-12-11 
Now that the HelpPanel cannot work in FD3, I wrote a really simple plugin to OpenTheDoc. I am waiting for the HelpPanel for FD3  

Usage: There are 4 path(or URL) of the docs can be set: local Flashdoc, local Flexdoc, live Flashdoc, live Flexdoc. And you can choose to open the docs in either the FD's browser or the system's, however, they both have some problems.
